# Python101 For Beginners

####
# About Python 101 
Python 101 is series of beginner basic Python commands. The work in this collection demonstrates the skills I worked on to understand how to code basic commands using the Python language. 


# The Weather App
My goal is to eventually take some of these basic commands using Python to build a simple dashboard. For example, one of the exercise called on a weather api to identify the weather in a city or state in the United States. In the next level of my development, I plan to build out a simple html that show cases my ability to call on this api to display the weather. Pupps And Paws Adopt-A-Pet App is an online, searchable database of animals who need homes. It is also a directory of pets from animal shelters and adoption organizations across in Texas. Organizations maintain their own home pages and available-pet databases.

# Heroku PaaS: 


# My Mission
To to share the experience and basic commands used to learn Python:

Increase public awareness of the opportuntiy to learn basic Python for beginners.
Increase the overall effectiveness of using simple commands to learn the fudementals of coding using Python.
Taking those commands to the next level and learn how to build out dashboards or a simple front end web application.
From the comfort of their personal computers, beginners who want to learn to code can use these simple examples to develop the fundementals that will help build their level comfort and progress to more advance coding using python.
