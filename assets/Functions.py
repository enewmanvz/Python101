# Functions are like mini programs that complete a specific task.
# They give the expected Results

# For example:


print("Hello World")    #print takes a string(s) and print to console

name = input('Enter your name:\n')  #Input prompts a user for input and print to console

amount = int(10.6)  #int() converts a given number to a integer and returns it

# roll = random.randint(1,6)   # randint() takes in a low and high bound and returns a random integer w/in that range

# REASONS TO CREATE A FUNCTION:
    #1 You wan to reuse a chunck of code over and over
    #2 You want to organize your code by logical units.
